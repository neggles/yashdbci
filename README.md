# `yashdbci` (Yet Another Self Hosted Discord Bot Container Image)
[![yagpdb build](https://github.com/neggles/yashdbci/actions/workflows/build-push.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/neggles/yashdbci/actions/workflows/build-push.yml)

this builds docker images for [YAGPDB](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb) with GH actions
and publishes them to GHCR

that's about all there is to it really
